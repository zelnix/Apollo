"""Alert notification boundary (spec §10A push protocol).

Delivery goes through Apollo's managed push relay: the app registers the device's native FCM/APNs token, the relay
resolves tokens from the installation id at send time, and no device token is ever stored here. Permission,
registration and delivery remain separate states. Every send is one durable delivery per (owner, event, channel,
recipient) with a payload digest and attempt history. A queued request, an accepted relay response and a visible
notification are separate outcomes; nothing is reported "sent" without a registered recipient and an accepted
response, and a timeout after send is `outcome_unknown` until retried — never a definite non-delivery.
