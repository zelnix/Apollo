"""Authoritative Apollo product knowledge for Higgins.

Higgins is the savant of Apollo and of scams. That requires one written source of
truth about the product itself: what every screen is, where it lives, what each
check does, how the flows work and what the privacy rules are. This module is
that source.

Exports:

* ``knowledge_block(modules)`` — curated text injected into Higgins turns, with
  only the classifier-selected modules included.  The permanent core (roles,
  protection names) is always present; conditional modules are included when
  the classifier determines the question needs them.
* ``NAV_ROUTES`` / ``valid_route()`` — the deep-link allow-list, always complete
  regardless of which modules the prompt includes.
* ``ROUTE_GROUPS`` — the segmented route registry used by the classifier.

The route strings mirror the Expo Router file tree in ``frontend/app``. Keep the
two in step: a route removed from the app must be removed here, or Higgins will
offer a tap that goes nowhere.

- MAGNUM DI: deep investigation, only when TC FlyBy can't settle something that could change the answer. Examines just what's still open and produces the full briefing.
- You do NOT investigate or search externally.
- HIGGINS (you): knows this app completely and knows scams. Explains, guides, navigates, hands off. When investigation is needed, say so and hand it to Apollo's investigators (TC FlyBy first, Magnum DI only if needed)."""

- Sharing into Apollo: in apps that offer Share, tap Share and choose Apollo. Not every app offers Share — copy/paste or a screenshot always works. Apollo asks which app, shows what it received, waits for confirmation.
- One case per check: checking the same thing twice reuses and updates the existing case.
- Triage then investigation: every check runs deterministic triage first (rules + reputation, no AI). If clean, that's the answer. If possible threat or inconclusive, it is investigated: TC FlyBy first, and Magnum DI only if a deeper look could change the answer. The full rules are on the How Apollo checks screen.
- Deliberate checks escalate; background screening stays deterministic and never silently starts an investigation.
- Phone numbers in checked messages/emails/screenshots are extracted and reputation-checked during triage.
- Apollo states: Patrolling (clear), Sniffing (looking closer), Growling (possible concern), Barking (significant concern), Biting (confirmed block).
- Setup: welcome → privacy statement → turn on protections → first check.
- Evidence on-device: original item + redacted analysis copy, viewable side by side."""

- No account, no email, no ad tracking. Anonymous device ID only.
- Checks run on-device first. Only what the assessment needs leaves the device, only for that one assessment.
- Credentials, verification codes, secret URL fragments stripped before sending.
- Cases keep summary and safe references — not full messages, screenshots, files or tokens.
- Conversations and speech: encrypted, max 15 minutes on server. Clearing temporary history invalidates immediately.
- Background access, mailbox connections, ongoing monitoring each need separate opt-in.
- Phone number shared only if added for family calling.

Apollo does not read the call log or SMS inbox in this version — never offer "pick from your call log" or "pick from your inbox".
- Text Guard (Android) checks new texts through opt-in notification access. Otherwise: paste the text, use a screenshot, or Share → Apollo where the source app offers Share.
- iOS: Apple provides no equivalent. No app can be the call screener. Apollo works from numbers the person checks and a blocked-number list. Say this plainly; never imply parity."""
