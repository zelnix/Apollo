"""ApolloSG Settings → AI Provider & Model: the one provider and model every AI investigation call uses.

Magnum DI and TC FlyBy both use this one selection; TC FlyBy has no selection of its own. Ask Higgins makes no AI call.
The selection is stored in the database, so it applies from the next investigation on every server process and survives
restarts and redeploys. Who changed it and when is stored with it, and each change is written to the admin audit log.
An investigation keeps the model it started with (repository.create_job), so a change never alters existing results.

A model can be selected only when it is approved here AND can do everything an investigation needs (REQUIRED): the
fixed answer shape, reading images sent as evidence, and web search with sources. Its provider also needs a connected
adapter (services/higgins/adapters) and an API key on the server. Keys stay in server configuration: this module only
says whether one is set, never its value.

Nothing here ever switches model. If the selected model can't be used, the investigation fails and says why.
