"""Evidence-specific analysis for the PREVIEW simulator only.

The preview simulator replaces the external Gemini call. It must still return a result that is about
THE ACTUAL EVIDENCE — naming the sender, the link, the amount, the request and the pressure found in
the submitted material — otherwise every preview investigation reads as a vague "characteristics that
may warrant caution" statement and tells the person nothing.

This is deterministic, rule-based and quotes only what is present in the evidence. It never claims a
source was contacted, never invents a verdict the text does not support, and marks every finding it
reasons (rather than reads) as an inference. Production uses the real model; analyse() runs only
when the preview simulator is installed. The indicator reader it uses lives in indicators.py, so Apollo
Triage can use it in every environment without production loading this module.
