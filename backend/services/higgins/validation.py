"""Interface validation of Gemini's structured response (spec §7/§9): references, actions, completion.

Package 5 extends validation with INVESTIGATE → ASSESS → DIRECT → GUIDE → VERIFY structural enforcement.

No keyword/style filters. Violations are returned to the model for one targeted repair.

Structural rules:
- INVESTIGATE: Findings must reference registered evidence/source IDs; observation basis requires evidence
- ASSESS: Assessment must be supported by findings when concern is found
- DIRECT: Action-needed/urgent attention requires at least one action with a non-empty instruction
- GUIDE: When actions exist, recommendedActionIndex must be set; instructions must be actionable
- VERIFY: Completion 'complete' requires all material evidence examined; fabricated evidence rejected

Findings that make the same point are merged before the response is returned, so the same fact is
never stated twice in one result.
