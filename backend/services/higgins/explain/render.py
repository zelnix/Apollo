"""Higgins Plain-English Renderer: a validated result, in everyday words, in Apollo's wording only.

A presentation layer under the Evidence Lock. It can't add, drop or change a fact, a value, how sure Apollo is, how
serious it is, what to do or who established it. All it does is this:
  - removes Markdown, and swaps formal words for plain ones (words.PLAIN_SWAPS), never inside quotes or identifiers;
  - opens with what it is: the case's subject, in one fixed line (words.SUBJECT_LINE);
  - keeps each finding tied to its subject (facts.bind_subject), so a finding never becomes "the website";
  - says each point once (a sentence already said isn't repeated) — and two sentences are the same point only when
    they also have the same finding identity (identifiers, check, result), never because they look alike;
  - never shortens a finding, what remains unresolved or the reason for the status;
  - labels each finding with who established it and how firmly;
  - adds Apollo's fixed explanation of the first jargon word in a finding (words.GLOSSARY), marked as explanatory;
  - opens the status with the outcome's label and says how serious it is in one fixed line (words.SEVERITY).
No AI is used. The Fidelity Check (fidelity.py) compares the draft against the facts before anything is shown; any
part that fails is shown in Apollo's own words instead (`literal`).
