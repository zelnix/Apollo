"""Fidelity Check: before Higgins' plain English is shown, it is compared with the authoritative facts.

PASS only when nothing was lost, added or changed:
  - the outcome is stated by its label, and no other outcome is named;
  - how serious it is matches the attention level, word for word (words.SEVERITY);
  - every finding is there, in order, with the same meaning, confidence and who established it;
  - every sentence of the result is said somewhere, with the same meaning; and every plain sentence says something the
    result says (nothing unsupported);
  - every link, address, number, date and amount is kept, and none is added; quoted words stay word for word;
  - a contradiction in the evidence stays a contradiction;
  - nothing sounds more certain, safer, milder or more alarming than Apollo's own wording, and the right
    investigator gets the credit;
  - every step of what to do is kept; explanations are only Apollo's fixed ones.
Deterministic: no AI. Failure details name only the kind of problem and where, never content from the case.
