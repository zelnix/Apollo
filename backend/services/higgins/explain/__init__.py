"""Higgins Plain-English Renderer and Fidelity Check.

A validated result (TC FlyBy's or Magnum DI's) is explained in everyday words, in Apollo's wording only, and
checked against the result before anything is shown:
  1. facts.py   — the authoritative findings, in structured form (Subject → Check → Result for every finding), from
                  the validated result and the case's records;
  2. render.py  — the plain-English draft (no AI; fixed plain words, labels and explanations only);
  3. fidelity.py — the Fidelity Check: PASS only when nothing was lost, added or changed;
  4. briefing.py — the Higgins Case Briefing every surface projects, with its own Fidelity Check.
On FAIL the failing parts are put back in Apollo's own wording and checked again. If it still fails, the person sees
Apollo's own wording only (mode "literal"). The structured result is never changed: the explanation sits beside it,
and where the two could ever differ the structured result wins.
