"""The deciding test — is the case resolved at TC FlyBy, or could Magnum DI change the result?

    Could deeper Magnum DI investigation or reasoning change Apollo's finding or Higgins' action?
        NO  → TC FlyBy resolves the case. "Unable to determine" is a valid finished outcome.
        YES → only the unresolved element, with the minimum context it needs, goes to Magnum DI.

No input format, case category or uncertainty sends a case to Magnum DI by itself. A screenshot or document
is investigated through the content Higgins Triage extracted from it, like any text. Magnum DI's additional
capabilities, and the only situations in which they can change the result:

    reading   — content Triage couldn't extract (Magnum DI reads images and pages directly), when nothing
                already established settles what to do;
    reasoning — the wording and tactics of a message that asks for something consequential (money,
                credentials, personal details, remote access, changed payment details, gift cards or crypto,
                a call-back on an organisation's behalf) through a route no official source verified, when
                nothing established settles it;
    relating  — a contradiction whose explanation could reverse the finding: a register entry under a
                related-but-different name; an organisation named beside a link or address that isn't its own
                with nothing else to go on; a scam pattern's wording beside the organisation's genuine links
                when the request still goes somewhere unverified.

Within the concern outcomes (Concerning, Likely scam, Confirmed scam or threat) Higgins' action is the same
protective one, so Magnum DI is never called to move a case between them. The triggers are still checked when a
concern outcome was reached: unread content could hold a request that calls for a different or additional step
(or show a provisional concern was a false positive), and a contradiction about the very facts a provisional concern
rests on could reverse it. Established threat evidence is never overridden.

Weak signals (a redirect to another site, a newly registered domain, a direct download, a third-party reputation
warning, text found copied elsewhere) never make a case Concerning, alone or together. They count only as the
independent corroboration an impersonation or another warning sign needs.
