"""Apollo KB — established scam patterns, as official sources describe them.

Each pattern is an official source's description of a known scam, reduced to what defines it: the
hallmarks (who the message claims to be and the story it tells) and the ask (what it wants the person to
do). They are Apollo knowledge-base entries (kind "scam_pattern") like any other, with publisher, link and
authority tier, and TC FlyBy reads the markers from the KB entry itself.

TC FlyBy compares the submitted material with them deterministically — no AI, no cost:
  full     every defining indicator and the ask are present           → supports "Likely scam"
  opening  every defining indicator, no ask yet (family pattern only) → supports "Concerning"
  partial  some of it                                                 → not established on its own
Each indicator is a phrase-level construction (a request bound to what it asks for, a claim bound to its
subject), never a lone keyword, and a negated one ("we will never ask for your password") doesn't count.
Impersonation patterns also need the evidence-based indicator TC FlyBy established: the link isn't the
organisation's own. A match supports Apollo's assessment. It is general knowledge applied to the material,
never proof of the identity or intent of this particular sender.
