"""Higgins chat — the router. Higgins faithfully communicates what Apollo already knows. Ask Higgins makes NO AI call.

Each question goes to the first of these that applies; each one's work lives in its own module:
  1. Something specific to check → the shared investigation pipeline (pipeline_submit.py): TC FlyBy first, Magnum DI
     only when a deeper look could change the answer. Never answered here.
  2. A scam alert or Learn article the person opened → its source's own words (government_alerts, learning, presenter.py).
  3. What Apollo already established — Patrol findings, the phone's live state, recent investigations or Apollo's
     product knowledge → deterministic presentation (context_tools.py, presenter.py).
  4. Apollo's knowledge base — Learn articles, Scam Alerts, official guidance and researched trusted pages
     (knowledge.py), quoted with their provenance and labelled as general knowledge, never as a finding about a case.
When none of these covers a question, Higgins says so plainly — ApolloSG's trusted knowledge doesn't answer it —
rather than asking a general AI model. Questions outside Higgins' scope get a fixed reply.
Tavily is never used here — it only maintains the knowledge base.
