"""Apollo knowledge base (KB): reusable researched knowledge, searchable without AI.

Every entry keeps its source, link, authority tier, jurisdiction and dates, and Higgins quotes entries verbatim:
- learn_article      — published Learn with Higgins articles (in-app route)
- scam_alert         — official scam alerts and advisories from the government feeds
- official_guidance  — cyber.gov.au guidance (CC BY 4.0), shipped in data/cyber_gov_au_guidance.json
- scam_pattern       — established scam patterns as official sources describe them (teddy/patterns.py), with the
                       markers TC FlyBy compares submitted material against
- researched         — trusted pages found and maintained through Tavily (services/apollo_kb.py), versioned

Gemini's saved answers to general questions are NOT KB knowledge: they live in the reusable intelligence cache
(services/reusable_intel.py), labelled as Gemini's, with an expiry, and are never promoted into the KB.

KB knowledge is general knowledge. It is never evidence about anything a person asked Apollo to check.

Search is deterministic, with no AI: a MongoDB text index narrows candidates, then a fixed weighted rule decides
whether an entry really answers the question (see "Matching a question to an entry" below).
