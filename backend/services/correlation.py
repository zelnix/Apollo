"""Cross-source matching: for each website, phone number and email address in a case, what every ApolloSG source says
about it, side by side, with each source's own reference and freshness.

Sources: the free threat lists (services/threat_feeds.py), Google Safe Browsing (from the case's pre-gathered lookups),
ApolloSG's official-domain register and Official Organisation Directory (services/org_directory.py), the official scam
advisories ApolloSG holds, and ApolloSG's own observations (services/observed_intel.py).

It adds nothing to TC FlyBy's checks. The record goes to Magnum DI (teddy/report.magnum_brief) so it doesn't re-derive
what is known, and knows how current each piece is. ApolloSG's previous reports are said only in their approved words
(observed_intel.SAID) — never which device, how many or when (the owner's rule: devices are mutually exclusive). Nothing
here is ever a finding, and history never changes a case's outcome (services/higgins/history.py).
