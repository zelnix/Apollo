"""Idempotent, model-free projection of committed Higgins responses into Patrol.

One finding, one patrol record.  The projector takes a completed Magnum DI
investigation and ensures a single authoritative patrol event exists for it.

Indicators (indicator_host, claimed_brand, scenario) come exclusively from:
  1. The case's source_metadata captured at intake, or
  2. The ORIGINAL patrol event linked via client_submission_id.

We never extract metadata from Gemini's prose via regex.  If Apollo did not
record an indicator from actual intake/evidence, Patrol does not manufacture one.
