"""Remove every threat case and Patrol record, for every device (an administrator's one-off reset).

What goes: Patrol records, every investigation case and its parts (events, evidence, uploads, jobs, Magnum DI
transactions, Triage records), case history, saved reports, family-shared copies (shared events and incidents, notes,
shared scam alerts) and alerts still held for later.

Patrol events become delete markers holding only the event's id, its device and the reason, so:
  * every device drops its local copy through GET /api/patrol/removed (older app versions already do this);
  * a device that re-sends a deleted event is acknowledged without it being stored (`refuses` / `unsaved_ack`), so
    the cases can't come back from a device's delivery queue.
The reset itself is recorded in `case_wipes`; devices read it from GET /api/patrol/wipe and clear their remaining
local copies (saved checks, check history, device-held investigations, originals).

Kept: threat lists, Learn content, settings, devices and their sign-ins, family links, usage and cost records,
evidence receipts (ids only) and notification history.
