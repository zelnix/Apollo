"""ApolloSG's cross-device intelligence (part of the KB, server-side only): what independent ApolloSG findings say about a
website, phone number, email address, message or file, kept as one-way codes and per-device marks, never content.

The owner's rules:
- Cases never cross device boundaries. Another device's case is never sent to, shown on, named on or reconstructable on
  this one. A device receives only an approved, privacy-safe derived assertion (`assertion`): known malicious (High
  confidence), suspected malicious (Medium confidence) or mixed previous reports — never a count of devices, never that
  another device or person encountered it, never a case, a time or a verdict of anyone else's.
- Server-side consensus: each device's latest qualifying finding about a subject is one mark — supporting (a concern
  outcome), contradicting (a complete check that found no scam indicators), inconclusive (unable to determine) or
  insufficient evidence (part of the evidence couldn't be checked) — with whether it was independent and when.
  Unanimous means no contradicting mark exists; one contradicting mark removes unanimity at once (every assertion is
  worked out from the marks when it is read). Inconclusive and insufficient marks never break unanimity and are kept
  apart. A disputed subject asserts only "mixed previous reports", and only once THRESHOLD independent reports exist.
- No artificial consensus: a finding made while ApolloSG already asserted something about that subject to the case
  (`kbAsserted` in the TC FlyBy record: the cross-source record in Magnum DI's brief, or the history notes beside the
  result) is recorded as dependent and never counts as independent confirmation of the same assertion; a device's
  dependent finding never replaces its own earlier independent one. So Case A → assertion → Case B can never grow it.
- A device's own marks are never part of the assertion it receives (`exclude`): its own cases are its related cases.

Stored in ApolloSG's own indicator store (`threat_indicators`, source `apollosg-observed`):
- scope `observed`: one subject, as a one-way code (a website as `domain:<code>`). A website's name is stored readably
  only once THRESHOLD independent devices support it, because by then it is a pattern rather than one person's material.
- scope `observed_relation`: two websites, numbers or addresses that appeared together in supporting material.
- Each device is a mark made from the subject and the device together, so a device can't be followed from one subject to
  another. Marks older than WINDOW are dropped.

What is recorded: the subjects of a finished, non-simulated case, except an organisation's own or official address, a
shared platform, a free mail provider's domain, or a number on the Official Organisation Directory.
