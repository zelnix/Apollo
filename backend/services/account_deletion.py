"""Complete, device-scoped data deletion ("Delete My Apollo Data").

This is the authoritative server-side inventory + purge for everything Apollo holds
for one anonymous device identity. It is driven by the device's OWN explicit request;
it only ever selects records that belong to this device_id / owner_id (owner_id == device_id).

Design:
- `inventory(device_id)` returns an honest, category-grouped count of what Apollo currently
  stores for this device. Zero counts are reported truthfully (never hidden).
- `purge_device(device_id)` first invalidates the investigation generation so any late/in-flight
  worker cannot publish new content, then deletes every category, then revokes + removes the
  device identity itself. It returns a per-category count of what was removed.

No historical data for OTHER devices is ever touched.
