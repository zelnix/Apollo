"""Remove the preview data that was copied into production.

Production's database began as a copy of the preview database (about 2026-09-22 01:05 UTC; see
memory/DEVICE_INVESTIGATION_2026-10-27.md). Production did not exist before that copy, so in production every
record whose server-set time is at or before the copy is preview data. Content and settings that came with the copy
(Learn, the knowledge base, threat lists, the Official Organisation Directory, ApolloSG settings, migrations, caches)
are what production runs on and are kept.

Rules, per collection:
- time:   a server-set time field at or before the cutoff (string-typed values never match, so nothing is guessed);
- owner:  collections with no reliable time: rows not owned by a device production created itself;
- day:    daily counters before the copy's day;
- devices: identities created at or before the cutoff.
Nothing created after the cutoff is ever deleted.
