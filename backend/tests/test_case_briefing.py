"""Subject → Finding → Result survives every step, and the Higgins Case Briefing every surface shows.

The Stoko acceptance case: an email from hello@stoko.com, checked. The user-facing explanation keeps "stoko.com",
"hello@stoko.com", that no scam warning was found for "stoko.com", that hello@stoko.com is a published Stoko
contact, and the actual unresolved reason — and it never says "Needs you" without a decision the person owes.
