"""Related history (services/higgins/history.py): this device's own earlier cases and ApolloSG's previous encounters.

The owner's rules, proved:
- Devices are mutually exclusive: a related case is only ever one of this device's own; another device's case is never
  found, and nothing on screen says which device or how many devices encountered something.
- History never becomes evidence for the current case: TC FlyBy's checks never receive it, so it can't make or change
  the outcome; it is never a finding.
- It only adds weight: agreeing history raises the confidence of the concern findings about the same subject, one step.

Run: cd /app/backend && python -m pytest tests/test_related_history.py -q
