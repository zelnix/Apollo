"""The Magnum DI request contains exactly three things: the person's question, the case evidence it needs
(the submitted material in full, plus Teddy FlyBy's brief, each labelled with id and kind), and the response
schema. No system prompt, no framework, no summarised or duplicated representation of the material.

Runs against the preview simulator: the request below is the real one; only the external call is
replaced. Run: cd /app/backend && python -m pytest tests/test_gemini_request_shape.py -q
