"""A call check gets a real scam assessment, never a library answer.

- A case opened from a call check is a call to assess, never a general question for the knowledge base.
- The call as the person describes it is compared with Scamwatch's phone-scam patterns (bank or card provider asking
  for a code, fake police / tax office / government, fake tech support, delivery or parcel fees): a full match is
  Likely scam, settled by TC FlyBy with no AI call.
- Those patterns are for calls only: the same words in a message are compared with the message patterns.

Run: cd /app/backend && python -m pytest tests/test_call_investigation.py -q
