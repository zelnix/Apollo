"""Evidence model — server processing is never an evidence source (core/evidence_model.py).

Origin, evidence source, processing, completeness and privacy state are kept apart. Server Triage, TC FlyBy / Magnum DI
projection, device sync and storage never write or imply the server as the answer to "Where did this evidence come
from?", and never change a source once it is recorded. Records stored with the old "server_projected" / "incomplete"
values are read into the separated model without being rewritten.

Run: cd /app/backend && python -m pytest tests/test_evidence_model.py -q
