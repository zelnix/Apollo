"""Higgins Plain-English Renderer and Fidelity Check (services/higgins/explain).

- The renderer explains a validated TC FlyBy or Magnum DI result in plain words, Apollo's wording only, and never
  changes the structured result.
- The Fidelity Check fails a draft that loses, adds or changes anything; the failing part is put back in Apollo's own
  wording and checked again; if it still fails the person sees Apollo's own wording only ("literal").
- The admin portal shows PASS/FAIL, what was shown, why, and both texts while the case is held.
