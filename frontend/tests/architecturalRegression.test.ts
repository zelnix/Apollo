/**
 * Architectural regression tests — Point 6 acceptance criteria.
 * Each test exercises the ACTUAL PRODUCTION functions, not reimplemented logic.
 *
 * 1. Original findings survive sync (via mergeLocalAndRemoteEvents).
 * 2. Handled findings stay handled; new evidence reopens with reason.
 * 3. Repeated blocks retain enforcement evidence without duplicates.
 * 4. Higgins explanations: specific, evidence-backed, no generic fallbacks.
 * 5. Missing/stale/contradictory evidence can't create false claims.
 * 6. Privacy restrictions and enforcement truth gates intact.
 *
 * The finding-correlation criteria that used to sit here (distinct-finding counts and the
 * Protection Details finding builder) were removed with src/domain/protectionDetails.ts: Home now
 * derives its attention items from buildHomeAttention, which this file covers below.
