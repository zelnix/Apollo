// Chain invariants (Evidence Lock → Higgins Luddish → every screen), proved as tests — they never run in the app.
//   1. Higgins Luddish can't change locked evidence or findings: the lock is frozen and fingerprinted, explaining it
//      changes nothing in it or in the result it came from, and a lock that was tampered with is never reworded.
//   2. Presentation can't silently change the verdict, severity, confidence or status: Home, Threats, the Findings
//      Brief, Evidence, History and DI all say what the case result (caseBriefing.caseResult) says, for every outcome,
//      every attention level, with a briefing that passed its Fidelity Check, one that failed it, and none.
//   3. No screen works a verdict or severity out for itself.
// Run: cd /app/frontend && node --test tests/chainInvariants.test.ts
