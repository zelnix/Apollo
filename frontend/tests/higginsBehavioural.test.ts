/**
 * Higgins Behavioural & Privacy Acceptance Tests
 *
 * Tests proving:
 * 1. Actionable findings produce specific, evidence-supported instructions.
 * 2. Higgins guides users through corrective procedures (directive language).
 * 3. Each step has one clear action and relevant navigation.
 * 4. Completed actions are verified where supported.
 * 5. Unverified outcomes are never reported as completed.
 * 6. Uncertainty does not produce vague or misleading instructions.
 * 7. Benign observations do not generate unnecessary warnings.
 * 8. LLM privacy boundary strips credentials and minimises personal data.
 * 9. The same Higgins standard applies across all user-facing screens.
 * 10. Model responses cannot disclose personal data or falsely claim security actions.
