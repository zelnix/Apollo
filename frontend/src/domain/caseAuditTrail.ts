// The Threat Case History tab: a strict audit trail of what happened to the case and when, oldest first — the case
// created, Higgins Triage, TC FlyBy, the escalation, Magnum DI, evidence added, the Evidence Lock, the verdict, and
// what the person did with it. Every entry is a recorded event with its recorded time: a stage that didn't run has no
// entry, an event whose time wasn't recorded says so, and earlier results stay on the trail. Nothing from another case
// or another device appears here; sources and related cases belong to the Evidence tab and the Findings Brief.
// Pure: unit-tested in node.
