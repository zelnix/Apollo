// Higgins Luddish L1 — the Evidence Lock. What Apollo, TC FlyBy or Magnum DI established is frozen before any language
// stage starts: the state, every finding with who established it and how firmly, what isn't certain, what to do and
// who blocked it. Luddish may explain locked findings; it can't modify, reinterpret, strengthen or weaken them.
// A lock whose fingerprint no longer matches is never explained. Pure: no React, no native imports.
