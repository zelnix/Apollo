// Higgins Luddish L1 — the Luddish Rules: one approved set of words for every state ApolloSG reports. A state is
// taken only from what Apollo recorded, never inferred, and never made stronger or weaker. Each sentence has approved
// variations that say exactly the same thing, so Higgins doesn't sound robotic; a variation never changes the
// evidence, how sure Apollo is or how serious it is. Pure: no React, no native imports.
