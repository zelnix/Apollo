// Higgins Luddish L1 — the Luddish Dictionary: ApolloSG's approved plain-English names and meanings for cybersecurity,
// scam, device, email, web, phone, business-register and ApolloSG terms. One concept keeps one name (`avoid` lists the
// other words Higgins doesn't use for it). A term is swapped for plain words only where the swap means exactly the same
// thing (`plain`); every other term is kept and explained, because simplifying it would change what it means.
// The first entries are the server's glossary (backend/services/higgins/explain/words.py GLOSSARY), word for word.
// Explanatory only: a meaning is never case evidence. Pure: no React, no native imports.
