// Higgins Luddish L1 — the Luddish Composer. Takes a sealed Evidence Lock and writes Higgins' explanation in five
// parts, each from its own place and never mixed:
//   Finding (what Apollo found) → Meaning (what it means) → Importance (why it matters) → Limitation (how sure
//   Apollo is, and what isn't certain) → Action (what to do).
// Locked wording goes through Grammar & Punctuation (plain swaps, safe splits); Luddish adds only its approved state
// wording (rules.ts). Each part is checked on its own: a part whose plain wording changed anything goes back to
// Apollo's words. A sentence still hard to read is kept exactly and given a plain note beside it (dictionary meanings,
// or the state's "In short" line) — evidence fidelity outranks readability. General knowledge comes alongside,
// labelled, never as a finding. The technical detail is the locked wording itself. The whole explanation then passes
// the Evidence Fidelity Check, or Apollo's wording is used throughout. Pure: no React, no native imports.
