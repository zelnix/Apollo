// Threat Case facts, kept apart (Apollo's origin rule). Five separate things, none inferred from another — the
// fields behind them are read through src/domain/evidenceModel.ts:
//   origin         — every Threat Case begins on the device that detected it. Server processing, Magnum DI, syncing,
//                    privacy projection and missing evidence never change that, and never point anywhere else;
//   evidence       — what supplied the evidence (`evidence_provenance`). Never a server: processing is not a source;
//   processing     — what checked it: Higgins Triage on this device or on ApolloSG's servers, TC FlyBy, Magnum DI;
//   completeness   — what this case's record holds, and every check that didn't finish with its recorded reason;
//   representation — the privacy step that shaped what ApolloSG's servers worked from or keep.
// Missing evidence is never evidence of a threat: it only narrows what ApolloSG could verify. Pure, no Expo imports.
