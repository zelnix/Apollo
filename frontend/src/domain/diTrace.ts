// The DI tab: how the investigation reached its result, in the order it ran —
// Higgins Triage → TC FlyBy → Magnum DI → Evidence Lock — and the outside research behind it, each source with the
// fact it supports or points against. Plain words only: rule-book codes, token counts, cost and Magnum DI's raw reply
// are in the Admin Portal, never here. Every step is built from what was recorded (the Triage record, the case's
// routing, the Magnum DI transactions and the result itself). A stage with no record says so — nothing is inferred.
// Pure: unit-tested in node.
