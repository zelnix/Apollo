/**
 * Pure, testable event merge — reconciles local events with server records.
 *
 * This is the SINGLE function that determines the outcome of local + remote synchronisation.
 * It is imported by ApolloContext (production) and by regression tests (verification).
 *
 * Rules:
 * 1. Local content wins whenever this device holds its own full record: a DNS block, native protection or incomplete
 *    record is never replaced by the server's privacy-protected copy or summary.
 * 1b. Syncing never changes what supplied the evidence or where it was processed: the source and processing this
 *    device recorded are kept; the server's copy only fills in what this device didn't record.
 * 2. Server metadata is absorbed (patrol_record, investigation_case_id, etc.).
 * 3. Resolved/trusted events are never reopened unless the server carries genuinely new evidence
 *    (new enforcement_evidence.evidence_id not previously seen on this event).
 * 4. A server record with no local version (e.g. after a reinstall) is taken as-is. It is still this device's
 *    own case: records are per device, and server processing never changes where a case began.
