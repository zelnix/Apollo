## Outcome summary

- Deterministic situations: **35/35 passed**
- Browser journeys: **7/10 passed**
- Device-only scenarios: **6 pending and not counted as browser completions**
- External-source handling: **configured live services; individual unavailability is reported in actual UI outcomes**

## Device-only scenarios — not completed by browser evidence

- `site-native-confirmed-block` (site): Requires a real supported filter and device-recorded enforcement evidence.
- `call-native-screening-rejection` (call): Requires a real incoming call and supported call-screening role.
- `file-native-share-provider` (file): Requires Android/iOS share sheet, provider metadata and content URI access.
- `device-native-settings-return` (device): Requires real Settings deep links and refresh after returning to Apollo.
- `app-native-inventory-permissions` (app): Requires platform-exposed app inventory and permission observations.
- `network-native-enforcement` (network): Requires real network events; Stage 1D packet-blocking acceptance remains cancelled.

## Interpretation rule

A scenario passes only when the selected Gate is understandable, the detection preserves uncertainty, the investigation does not overclaim, Higgins provides a plain explanation, and the person can complete one labelled next action. Test count alone is not acceptance.
