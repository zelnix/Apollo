# Apollo Round 1 — expected versus actual

Generated: 2026-09-21T03:48:32.124993+00:00
Browser target: `https://apollo-patrol.preview.emergentagent.com`
Execution mode: **live**

Expected outcomes are source-controlled in `frontend/scripts/round1-scenario-engine.ts` before execution. Local preflight, real downstream browser evidence and device-only work are deliberately separate. Local preflight is not investigation/Higgins acceptance.

## Outcome summary

- Local application-logic preflight: **35/35 matched expectations** — not counted as external investigation or Higgins acceptance
- Browser journeys: **0/3 complete**, **1 partial**, **2 failed**, **0 blocked**
- Device-only scenarios: **6 blocked from browser completion and not counted as complete**
- External-source handling: **configured real services in every mode; no verdict, finding or Higgins response is injected**

## Local preflight across all ten Gates — not downstream acceptance

## Journey details — what the user actually saw

### `ui-link-threat` — PARTIAL

- **Expected:** Barking result; persistent trusted verification; truthful continue label
- **User saw:** Threat state Apollo is barking; This link does not belong to CommBank.; persistent verification instructions opened. Ambiguous shortened-link override label is truthful. Higgins quality: accuracy=yes, uncertainty=yes, action=yes, clarity=yes, depth=no. Exact live Higgins response: Please avoid the link and log in only via the official CommBank app. Apollo has noted that the provided link uses an unofficial '.xyz' TLD, which is the last part of a web address. Official communications from CommBank use 'commbank.com.au'. A technical inspection encountered a DNS failure, which is a failure to find the computer address for a website name. This often occurs with temporary scam pages. While no malicious listing was found, the domain—the unique name of a website—is not legitimate. If I may, I would suggest you treat this as a deceptive lure. Apollo has it in hand and confirms this address is not authorised.. Investigation display: LIVE INVESTIGATION: GEMINI COMPLETED — RESPONSE SHOWN VERBATIM. Sources shown: Submitted content analysis: INCONCLUSIVE — It looks like CommBank, but commbank-secure-verify.xyz is not one of CommBank's official domains.; Websites ending in .xyz are frequently used for scams.; The address mentions "com | Apollo link intelligence: INCONCLUSIVE — commbank-secure-verify.xyz: clean; coverage full. No current listing was found; this does not authenticate the site or prove safety. | Isolated webpage inspection: UNAVAILABLE — Inspection unavailable: dns_failed. | CommBank official guidance: CONCERN FOUND — Official domain: commbank.com.au. No submitted link matches.
- **Cause/gap:** Higgins answer for link did not explain why the evidence mattered
- **Artifact:** `/app/test_reports/round1_artifacts/live/ui-link-threat.png`

### `ui-file-handoff` — FAILED

- **Expected:** Evidence-first follow-up; recovery; automatic Higgins Retry and continuity
- **User saw:** AssertionError: Higgins output was rejected before reaching the user: File Gate showed Barking: This file is not really a PDF. Don't open it.; recovery worked. The user then saw: Higgins' answer did not meet Apollo's evidence rules. Retry.
- **Cause/gap:** AssertionError: Higgins output was rejected before reaching the user: File Gate showed Barking: This file is not really a PDF. Don't open it.; recovery worked. The user then saw: Higgins' answer did not meet Apollo's evidence rules. Retry.
- **Artifact:** `/app/test_reports/round1_artifacts/live/ui-file-handoff.png`

### `ui-device-setting` — FAILED

- **Expected:** Visible limitation, working setting guidance and retained Higgins context
- **User saw:** AssertionError: Higgins output was rejected before reaching the user: Device Gate showed Growling: 1 item worth reviewing. Nothing confirmed dangerous.; the initial Higgins answer arrived. The user then saw on follow-up: Higgins' answer did not meet Apollo's e

## Device-only scenarios — blocked from browser evidence

- `site-native-confirmed-block` (site) — **BLOCKED**: Requires a real supported filter and device-recorded enforcement evidence.
- `call-native-screening-rejection` (call) — **BLOCKED**: Requires a real incoming call and supported call-screening role.
- `file-native-share-provider` (file) — **BLOCKED**: Requires Android/iOS share sheet, provider metadata and content URI access.
- `device-native-settings-return` (device) — **BLOCKED**: Requires real Settings deep links and refresh after returning to Apollo.
- `app-native-inventory-permissions` (app) — **BLOCKED**: Requires platform-exposed app inventory and permission observations.
- `network-native-enforcement` (network) — **BLOCKED**: Requires real network events; Stage 1D packet-blocking acceptance remains cancelled.

## Weakest outcomes

- `ui-link-threat` — **PARTIAL**: Threat state Apollo is barking; This link does not belong to CommBank.; persistent verification instructions opened. Ambiguous shortened-link override label is truthful. Higgins quality: accuracy=yes, uncertainty=yes, action=yes, clarity=yes, depth=no. Exact live Higgins response: Please avoid the link and log in only via the official CommBank app. Apollo has noted that the provided link uses an unofficial '.xyz' TLD, which is the last part of a web address. Official communications from CommBank
- `ui-file-handoff` — **FAILED**: AssertionError: Higgins output was rejected before reaching the user: File Gate showed Barking: This file is not really a PDF. Don't open it.; recovery worked. The user then saw: Higgins' answer did not meet Apollo's evidence rules. Retry.
- `ui-device-setting` — **FAILED**: AssertionError: Higgins output was rejected before reaching the user: Device Gate showed Growling: 1 item worth reviewing. Nothing confirmed dangerous.; the initial Higgins answer arrived. The user then saw on follow-up: Higgins' answer did not meet Apollo's e

## Runtime mocks, templates and deterministic fallbacks

- Web preview native device/network/app observations remain simulated or unavailable and are never treated as physical-device evidence.
- The deterministic 35-scenario engine is expectation preflight only; it does not stand in for external investigation or a Higgins response.
- Investigation fallback assessments remain a runtime safety path when Gemini is unavailable or rejected. The UI labels them as deterministic fallback, and any journey using one is PARTIAL rather than complete.
- Structured Higgins handoffs retry real Gemini once after a transport or grounding rejection. They do not substitute a canned answer; after both attempts fail, the user sees a Retry error and the journey is FAILED or BLOCKED.

## Remaining capability gaps

- **Bounded evidence handoff:** Ask Higgins currently carries at most 8 findings, 6 uncertainty items and 4 supported actions. Each item is length-bounded; longer investigations can still lose lower-priority evidence.
- **Bounded investigation inputs:** Message/email text and isolated webpage excerpts are intentionally capped before Gemini processing. This protects privacy and latency but is not complete-document or complete-page analysis.
- **Restricted research:** Live investigation uses configured reputation sources, official-brand guidance and an SSRF-protected page fetch. It has no unrestricted general web-research tool; DNS/SSRF/provider failures remain unresolved evidence rather than inferred verdicts.
- **Provider/guard compatibility:** Real Gemini prose can still fail the unsupported-capability, uncertainty or action contract. Ask Higgins then shows a Retry error and does not silently replace the answer.
- **Native scope:** Physical Stage 1D work remains cancelled. Native macOS/Windows enforcement adapters remain backlog, while current device-specific Settings guidance is still reviewed in browser where possible.

## Interpretation rule

A scenario passes only when the selected Gate is understandable, the detection preserves uncertainty, the investigation does not overclaim, Higgins provides a plain explanation, and the person can complete one labelled next action. Test count alone is not acceptance.
