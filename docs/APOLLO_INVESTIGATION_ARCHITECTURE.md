# Apollo investigation architecture (as built, 2026-09-21)

## Boundaries

| Layer | File | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| Gemini boundary | `backend/services/higgins/provider.py` | Sole AI transport (`google-genai`, owner `GEMINI_API_KEY`). Capability registry per model; complete-input token admission; SDK retries disabled; finish reason, usage and grounding preserved. Non-STOP = incomplete. |
| Contracts | `backend/services/higgins/contracts.py` → `frontend/src/investigation/types.ts` | Strict Pydantic (`extra="forbid"`, camelCase wire). `InvestigationCase`, `EvidenceItem`, `Coverage`, `SourceReference`, `Finding`, `HigginsResponse`, `Job`, `Failure`, `TurnCommit`, `DeviceRequest/Result`, `SettingsPlan`, `RecheckResult`, request models. `ModelResponse` is the model-facing subset (IDs assigned server-side). |
| Repository | `repository.py` | Owner-scoped Mongo access; Fernet-encrypted content fields; CAS on the case control record; idempotency store; evidence chunks; jobs/events; staged→accepted turn commit; revoke/cleanup/expiry sweep. |
| Evidence | `evidence.py` | Ingest text/url/observation/file; signature sniffing vs declared type; PDF (pypdf) / DOCX (python-docx) / TXT extraction into a derived child item with page offsets; image budget; coverage ledger (`mark_examined`, range union); model parts (inline ≤24k chars, images inline, longer via `read_evidence`). |
| Tools | `tools.py` | Function declarations + executor: `read_evidence`, `research_public_sources` (separate Gemini Search-grounded call with minimal public identifiers), `inspect_url` (redirects + SSRF-safe fetch), `lookup_reputation` (Safe Browsing/blocklist/IPQS via existing services), `lookup_breach` (HIBP), `research_application`, `request_device_observation`, `research_settings`, `ask_user`. Tool output is data; ownership comes from `ToolContext`. |
| Validation | `validation.py` | Interface checks only: schema, registered evidence/source IDs, capability-bound actions, completion/question consistency, provider completion. Machine-readable errors → one repair call. No style/keyword filters. |
| Coordinator | `coordinator.py` | Brief (inventory + history + open question + device profile) → function-calling loop (≤10 rounds) → JSON response → validate/repair → stage → single CAS accept. Pauses on `device_request` with an encrypted checkpoint of the conversation; resumes with the device result appended. |
| Jobs | `jobs.py` | Lease acquire (fenced), 10 s heartbeat, transient retry (429/5xx/timeout; ≤2, jittered backoff within deadline), typed failures, `partial` + `failed` events, `recover()` for expired leases at startup and every sweep. |
| HTTP | `routers/investigations.py` | Spec §8 routes: capabilities, create (Idempotency-Key), get, evidence (JSON + multipart), resumable uploads, evidence/sources/turns pages, turns (202), job, SSE events (`after=`), resume, cancel, delete, device-results, settings-plan, recheck, speech (job + authenticated audio), reports. Error body `{"error": Failure}` (server-level handler). |
| Compatibility | `routers/ask.py` | `/ask/stream` creates/continues a case per `conversation_id` and streams the committed response; `/ask/history` and `DELETE` derive from cases. No second engine. |
| Frontend | `src/investigation/{types,client,caseStore,deviceBroker}.ts`, `src/components/InvestigationView.tsx`, `app/(tabs)/ask.tsx` | Idempotent create/turn; SSE via XHR with sequence reconnect; EOF without terminal event → poll job → resume stream; per-case expiry; faithful overview + expandable explanation, findings by basis, sources with authority label, coverage, question answering, actions, Retry/Cancel. |

## Authoritative commit (spec §5)

1. `stage_turn` writes the encrypted `TurnCommit` with `staged=True`.
2. `accept_turn` performs one `find_one_and_update` on the case matching `owner_id, case_id, epoch, active_job_id, lease_fence, deleted=False, expires_at>now`; it sets `response_ciphertext`, `response_revision`, `status`, clears the active job and appends `turn_id` to `accepted_turn_ids`, incrementing `revision`.
3. Only then is the bundle flipped to `staged=False`. Readers (`accepted_turns`) require both `staged=False` and membership in `accepted_turn_ids`. A failed CAS deletes the staged bundle; the sweeper reclaims stale staged bundles.
4. Cancel/delete/expire rotate `epoch`; an old worker's CAS cannot match. `completed` is emitted only after the accept succeeds.

## State transitions

`queued → investigating → (retry_wait ↔ investigating) → complete | partial | waiting_user`; `investigating → waiting_device → queued (device result) → investigating`; any active → `cancelled` (turn) ; case → `expired` (sweeper/read-time) or `deleted`. `attention` (`none/review/action_needed/urgent`) is a separate projection; Biting is never derivable from it.

## Known gaps

Frontend `deviceBroker` returns honest `unavailable` for every request until Apollo-owned native adapters are bound (Stage C). Site/Link/Network/App/Device Gate screens still hand off summaries only. Delivery adapters (email/push/storage) remain 503 stubs pending owner credentials. Speech in the UI uses the existing protected `/voice/speak` path rather than `/investigations/{id}/speech`.
