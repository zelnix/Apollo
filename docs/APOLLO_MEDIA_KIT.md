# Apollo downloadable media kit

Generated without Playwright or runtime scenario automation from the current React Native source and authentic Apollo animation assets.

## Public downloads

- Gallery: `https://apollo-platform.preview.emergentagent.com/apollo-media-kit/`
- Complete ZIP: `https://apollo-platform.preview.emergentagent.com/apollo-media-kit/apollo-media-kit.zip`
- Machine-readable manifest: `https://apollo-platform.preview.emergentagent.com/apollo-media-kit/manifest.json`

## Inventory

- 28 faithful static screen exports: Home, Higgins, Gates, Patrol, Family, Family Help and Gmail connected; each at iPhone 390×844 and Android 412×915 in light and dark-preference variants.
- 6 transparent mascot loops: resting, sniffing/loading, growling/warning, barking/danger, biting/blocked and success.
- 6 full-screen state demonstrations for the same Apollo states.

The current app intentionally maps the dark preference to the same Light Sentinel palette. Therefore the light/dark screen pairs match; this avoids inventing a theme that is not present in source.

## Reproduction

Run `python frontend/scripts/generate-apollo-media-kit.py`, then package `frontend/public/apollo-media-kit`. Source assets remain under `frontend/assets/images`; generated media stays under `frontend/public/apollo-media-kit`.
