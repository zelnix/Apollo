# Package 6 native source delivery — 2026-09-22

- iOS source resolves four app extensions under `app.apollo.hwg`: Content Blocker, Call Directory, Message Filter and Share Extension.
- Windows source includes an Apollo WFP ALE service, actual drop-event app/process attribution, bounded evidence, NSIS service hooks and Tauri bridge. MinGW x64 compile/link passed; temporary PE output was deleted.
- macOS source includes an `NEFilterDataProvider` system extension, source-app attribution/evidence, activation helper, entitlements, XcodeGen manifest and unsigned embedding recipe.
- Bounded validation: TypeScript, ESLint, Python lint, 379 Node tests, 61 provider-disabled pytest tests, Cargo check, 5 Rust tests, Package 6 preflight and staging/production preflights pass.
- Frozen GuardDog package roots remain unchanged. No signed build, installer, notarisation, deployment or physical-device acceptance was performed.
- Source manifest: 625 files, SHA-256 `facb85bf40e186fcb6bc61ef668a2b81b72e9250d21962914c38b66a25bff6f6`.
- Detailed record: `APOLLO_PACKAGE6_SOURCE_DELIVERY_RECORD.md`.

# Phase 2 source remediation — 2026-09-22

- Reviewed/starting SHA: `6fbd5b3bd5711a2ef0530da7c24a162ca2b57e79`.
- Production and app-bundle source now default to fail-closed `guarddog_production`; signed authority remains mandatory.
- Android package remains `app.apollo.hwg`; no frozen GuardDog package file changed.
- Bounded checks: TypeScript, ESLint, Python lint, 373 Node tests, 61 provider-disabled pytest tests, staging/production preflight and Cargo all pass.
- Backend health is 200 and the learning catalogue initialises exactly 35 published articles.
- No build, signing, deployment, scenario, Playwright, testing-agent or live-Gemini run was performed.
- Final source manifest SHA-256: `ed31a214ebccdaf80a9fae4e5dd4b9700e50d5ef58d8fc6f23eedd98a9749e67` across 606 source files.
- Final GitHub SHA remains pending Save to GitHub; this is a source-handoff requirement, not a source-test failure.
- Detailed closure: `APOLLO_PHASE2_SOURCE_REMEDIATION_RECORD.md`.

# Phase 2 baseline record — 2026-09-22

- Controlling Phase 2 source baseline was recorded before source edits as `d1ab4ff22f7476fefd3999e6c292c3ac92f2e30b` on local `main`.
- No Git remote/upstream is configured in this workspace; the exact current saved repository HEAD above is the available GitHub-derived baseline and is not reset to the older review anchor.
- M1–M4 remain accepted and closed. Phase 2 executes only P2.1–P2.6 and C19–C25/V27–V36.
- Full execution ledger: `docs/APOLLO_PHASE2_EXECUTION_RECORD.md`.

## Phase 2 RC1 source record — 2026-09-22

- Release identity: Apollo `1.1.0`; Android `versionCode 2`; iOS `buildNumber 2`; desktop `1.1.0`.
- Android package/application ID remains `app.apollo.hwg`.
- Bounded verification passed: TypeScript, ESLint, Python lint, 53 provider-disabled pytest checks, device-test security preflight, Cargo and all three Apollo-owned Android release Kotlin modules.
- The native compile closed missing `kotlinx-serialization-json` visibility in `apollo-security` and removed a stale `ApolloVpnGuardReceiver` reference after its work had already been replaced by the durable WorkManager schedule.
- No signed Android artifact is recorded: the build host is Linux ARM64 and React Native's bundled Hermes compiler has no matching host binary. A fake compiler and misleading installable artifact were explicitly rejected.
- GuardDog production-default cutover remains inactive and separate.
- Runtime closure: MongoDB/backend/Expo are RUNNING, backend health is 200 and the protected preview proxy is HTTP 200. The deployment scanner's sole remaining complaint is a missing `--tunnel` flag in an explicitly read-only Supervisor file that already supplies the protected proxy URL; source/env/security checks otherwise pass.

# GuardDog production authority track — source record (2026-09-22)

- Added an explicit, non-default `guarddog-production` engine/profile. Existing production `app-bundle` remains `legacy`.
- Apollo owns one native process runtime; the frozen Expo bridge remains excluded. Trust-generation transitions stop/recover/drain/clear/rebuild before resuming.
- Added pinned primary/recovery public-root configuration, strict signed trust manifests, ordinary-key validity/revocation, HMAC-bound rollback state, generation-scoped bundle stores, routine signed refresh and exact-expiry stop work.
- Acceptance test IDs/keys are rejected by production plugin, runtime and preflight.
- Added offline-only manifest/rule signing tools that refuse private key files inside the application repository.
- **External inputs still required for production selection:** owner public roots, signed trust/rule artifacts and HTTPS update URLs. Private keys remain offline and are never requested by the app/CI.
- **Cutover state:** not selected, not production-default, and not represented as native-build verified. Android package remains `app.apollo.hwg`.
- Verification boundary remains owner-mandated: TypeScript, ESLint, backend pytest and Cargo only; no Gradle/Kotlin compile or live-device GuardDog campaign was run.

## Production app-bundle pre-install failure — fixed in source

- Failed EAS build: `4dee4d9b-99ba-48db-825d-1f63c22414db` (Android app bundle, versionCode 110).
- Fatal phase: `PRE_INSTALL_HOOK`, before native compilation. The deployment-created `app-bundle` profile inherited development-web values from `.env`: `EXPO_PUBLIC_APP_ENV=development` and `EXPO_PUBLIC_DEVICE_PREVIEW_HARNESS=enabled`. Apollo's security preflight correctly rejected shipping simulated preview-device input in a native build.
- Fix: `eas.json` now defines an explicit production-safe `app-bundle` profile; `.env.production` explicitly selects production/legacy/harness-off; `security-preflight.mjs` prevents every EAS native profile from inheriting base development-web defaults while preserving the fail-closed rejection of an explicitly unsafe profile.
- Source hygiene: `.easignore` excludes generated native/build caches. Local ignored Rust, Metro, desktop-dist and Ruff artifacts (about 3.6 GB) were removed before the next deployment archive.
- Verification: app-bundle, production, device-test and GuardDog acceptance pre-install matrices pass with their intended values; an explicit app-bundle + enabled preview harness still fails; security configuration tests 6/6; TypeScript and script lint clean; production Expo config resolves the expected native package and EAS project.
- The preparer log `expo: command not found` was non-fatal in this run: project linking and EAS submission continued successfully. The EAS worker's only fatal error was the intentional security-preflight rejection above.
- **Artifact status:** build `4dee4d9b-99ba-48db-825d-1f63c22414db` remains failed and contains no artifact. A new app-bundle build is required to validate the corrected source; no successful replacement build is claimed here.

Build `c46c1d78-d662-4cd6-a45d-292ffe175247` is **not a candidate**: it failed in EAS Pre-install because
the uploaded development `.env` enabled the browser preview harness. Commit `7fd6f9a...` explicitly sets
`EXPO_PUBLIC_DEVICE_PREVIEW_HARNESS=off` in all native EAS profiles; all three local profile preflights passed and
Deployment Agent returned PASS before the successful retry.

### Artifact inspection (performed on the downloaded APK)
- JS bundle (`assets/index.android.bundle`, 5.10 MB): `PreviewDeviceAdapter`, `MOCKED DEVICE INPUT`, `MockSecurityAdapter`, `MockSecureCore`, `WebSecurityAdapter`, `EXPO_PUBLIC_SECURITY_MODE` — **all absent**; `getDeviceProfileFacts`, `open_settings.vpn`, fail-closed message — present.
- DEX: `ApolloSecurityModule`, `ApolloSmsListenerService`, `GuardDogVpnService` present. Manifest declares `POST_NOTIFICATIONS`.

### Install (Pixel 10)
Open the APK link on the phone (or `adb install apollo-device-test.apk`), allow "install unknown apps" for the browser once, install, open Apollo. First run shows onboarding; the Settings tab shows the real adapter label (`Android — Apollo DNS filter`) and no preview banner.

### Build history
| Build | Result | Cause / fix |
|---|---|---|
| `d54b2c70-6a1d-4f17-8255-f9cce2ed2b7f` | errored (Gradle, 9m38s) | `:apollo-security:compileReleaseKotlin` — `Unresolved reference 'activeSessionId'` ×3 in `ApolloGuardDogCandidateRuntime.kt` (frozen SDK e5d11be has no such field). Fixed in `fa9bf2f` by deriving the live TUN-session identity from `GuardDogVpnRuntime.activeSession`. Pre-existing packaging fixes in the same run: `app.json` slug → `threat-patrol-1` (EAS project mismatch), `gradle-wrapper.jar` tracked. |
| `e32f6068-b349-4de8-ab5d-8c950a6596bf` | **finished** (25m) | — |

Known build warnings (non-blocking): `expo-updates` not installed although the profile declares a channel (channels unused); `expo-doctor` warns about the tracked `android/` directory (bare workflow is intentional for the GuardDog modules).

## iOS / iPadOS — `device-test` profile
Attempted (`eas build --platform ios --profile device-test --non-interactive`): stops at **credential setup** — `EAS CLI couldn't find any credentials suitable for internal distribution`. Targets recognised: `app.apollo.hwg`, `app.apollo.hwg.contentblocker`, `app.apollo.hwg.share-extension`.
Genuinely missing owner inputs: Apple Developer team credentials (App Store Connect API key `.p8` + key id + issuer id, or an interactive Apple ID login) and the test devices' UDIDs (`eas device:create`) for ad-hoc internal distribution — or TestFlight instead. Nothing else blocks the iOS build.

## Windows / macOS
Tauri host in `/desktop`; no Windows/macOS runner in this workspace, so no installer produced yet (see `APOLLO_PLATFORM_DELIVERY_MATRIX.md`).
